=== magdec.bgl

A file containing the magnetic declination from 1/1/2017. This file is used only when loading X-Plane data
to fill the missing declination values for airports, NDB, waypoints and ILS.

The magnetic declination file from the simulator scenery will be used if loading scenery data for FSX/P3D.
You can override this behavior by copying the included magdec.bgl from this directory to 
Little Navmap's settings directory C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\ABarthel

Thanks to Herv√© Sors (http://www.aero.sors.fr) for allowing me to include this file with Little Navmap.
