# Version 1.0.21.beta

## Related notes from atools Version 3.6.3.beta and 3.6.4.beta

* Fixed issue with missing longest runway surface for airports with MSFS.
* Now imitating the behavior of MSFS if an scenery update tries to reuse the ident of an airport
  for a new one. Example: Boyd Field (54XS) in MSFS which actually Bar C Ranch Airport (54XS) in
  real life at another location.
* Fixed issue where military airports were not recognized in add-ons.
* Adjusted detection of MSFS Navigraph navdata update to avoid all airports being detected as add-on.

===============================================================================

# Version 1.0.20.beta

## Related notes from atools Version 3.6.2.beta

* Fixed issue where program could appear frozen while counting files for loading scenery.
* Fixed detection for military airports in MSFS and extended this with new phrases.
* Now capitalizing all airport names for FSX, P3D and MSFS to fix wrong airbase designators
  like  `Afb`.
* Fixed issue with NOAA weather downloads where a missing internet connection flooded the log and
  caused the program to crash. Now applying a grace period of three minutes after an error which
  blocks new downloads for METAR requests.
* Removed wrong rounding of COM frequencies.
* Now checking for all paths `Community`, `fs-base` and `fs-base-nav` before recognizing a MSFS
  installation as valid.
* `asobo-airports-*` in `Official\Steam` or `Official\OneStore` are now flagged as add-on.

===============================================================================

Version 1.0.19.beta

Related notes from atools Version 3.6.1.beta

MSFS:

* Fixed issue with `NOT NULL constraint failed:tmp_waypoint.ident Unable to fetch...`.
  Navids with empty names are now ignored and printed into the log with BGL file name.
* Changed default MSFS Steam flight plan path to base folder `Microsoft Flight Simulator`.
* Localizer heading for MSFS now saved correctly in scenery database.
* Also looking in `OneStore` and `Steam` folder for add-ons now.
* Updating administrative names in airports now if missing in update. This also corrects missing
  names for the Navigraph navdata update.
* Adapted to Navigraph navdata update 12 for MSFS.
  Updating only needed features which are airports, COM and ILS. Everything else is ignored and not
  needed since it can be updated directly for Little Navmap.
* Corrected ILS course for Navigraph update in simulator. Slight variations like for EDDM remain.

Other:

* Airports with empty names now raise an exception which will show an error dialog to the user.
* Removed unneeded indexes from tables `nav_search` and `taxi_path` to shrink database.
* Updated to world magnetic model 2020. This will be used to calculate X-Plane declination when
  loading the scenery database.
* Fixed issue where declination was not created correctly for locale which do not have a . as
  decimal separator. This is due to functions in WMM code. As a result of the issue declination was
  20 degrees off near VORDME STN in X-Plane, for example. #564
* Removed unused delete_airport table to speed up loading and to keep database small.
* Now capitalizing airport, city, state and country names when loading FSX, P3D or MSFS data.

Related notes from atools Version 3.6.0.beta

Scenery Database:

* Full MSFS scenery library support with simulator detection.
* Progress for scenery database loading with FSX/P3D, X-Plane and DFD reworked to avoid
  under- or overflow and to have a more balanced progress rate.
* Fixed issues with user home folders containing special characters. This caused various
  issues when detecting flight simulators.
* Added more invalid taxiway names like `_` to avoid in X-Plane.


Other, technical, internal or development related:

* Updated file roller to allow usage of file rename patterns.
* Updated logging for separate debug message and narrow patterns which remove namespaces from class
  and paths from filenames for better readability.

===============================================================================

Version 1.0.18

All changes from atools version 3.4.7.
Mostly fixes for DFD and other data compilers.

All data compilers and schema changes:
* Updated database minor version to 18 to reflect changes.
* Fixed issue with duplicate waypoints in airways for DFD, X-Plane and FSX/P3D compiler causing
  defects in airway network. Examples: MY/EK and SYA/PA. #516
* Added flag "artificial" for NDB and VOR waypoints which are created to simplify
  airway construction. Useful for debugging or future versions. #516

DFD:
* Updated DFD compiler to create new and separate UIR FIR airspace types besides the old
  deprecated center with "(FIR)" or "(UIR)" in the name. These new types will be used by the next
  Little Navmap version. Current versions 2.4.X are compatible with this change and show
  the old centers. #462
* Fixed issue where runway ends with more than one ILS had all except one detached from runway.
  Example: EDDF RWY25R ILSZ IFNW. #532
* Coordinates for fix and recommended fix in procedure tables added. Used for better navaid
  resolution in next Little Navmap version. #205
* Adding artificial waypoints to allow procedure fix resolution in LNM versions <= 2.4.5 in DFD databases.

X-Plane:
* Improved removal of "[X]" prefixes in X-Plane and fixed issue where military airports were not
  detected in all cases.
* Changed airport ident to ICAO code for X-Plane compiler now. XP internal ids are now avoided
  except in duplicates. Added xpident to airport table which keeps the internal ID for
  X-Plane airports. #448
* Added runway smoothness and airport flatten flags from X-Plane to database schema.
* Corrected navaid range calculation for X-Plane. 125 NM is now treated as unpublished.

P3D:
* Fixed issue with P3D v5 not loading tower, unicom and other frequencies for all airports.
  As a result all airports are shown in magenta color.

===============================================================================

Version 1.0.17

P3D v5: #512
* Added P3D v5 for simulator detection.
* Adapted loading of BGL files to P3D v5 structure changes and added new records as well as new COM
  and other types.
* Enabled loading of add-on packages from `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Prepar3D v5 Add-ons`.
