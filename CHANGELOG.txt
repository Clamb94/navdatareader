Version 1.0.5

* No changes except version.

1.0.4.beta

* Adjusted basic validation for new results after fixes in atools.

from atools version 2.8.2.beta

* DFD compiler now estimates if holding is given in time or distance for procedure legs.
* DFD compiler now always sets region for fixes where it was missing for procedure legs.
* Solved problem where fix was not set for DME distance and radial terminated procedure legs.
  Now copying recommended fix to avoid invalid procedures.

1.0.3.beta

* Calculating range from NDB navaid_class now.
* Basic validation values are now more precise for DFD compilation.
* Fixed logging configuration to produce separate error and warning log now.
* DFD compiler now estimates if holding is given in time or distance for procedure legs.
* DFD compiler now always sets region for fixes where it was missing for procedure legs.
* Solved problem where fix was not set for DME distance and radial terminated procedure legs. Now copying recommended fix.

1.0.2.beta

* Updated manual re. error reporting and compilation failure.
* Program now fails on all kind of errors with return code 1.

from atools version  2.8.0.beta
* Fixed crash when getting simulator base path for unknown simulator type.

1.0.1.beta

* All indexes are dropped after compilation now to save download bandwidth.
  Indexes are created again by Little Navmap on first database usage on the client's side.
* Small fixes in logging where messages went to stderr where they shouldn't.
* Added DropAllIndexes option in configuration file.
* Extended database metadata with optional compiler_version, valid_through and data source columns.
* Increased database minor version to 6.

from atools version 2.8.0.beta

* Finished DFD to Little Navmap database compiler for Navigraph data. #126
* Added script table and option to store create index scripts in that table for preparation by the client. #126
* Added option to drop indexes after database creation to keep the file small.
* Vacuum and analyze option for database creation now defaults to true to get smaller and better organized files. #126
* Fixed error with wrong ILS pitch in X-Plane compiler.
* Disabling maximum airway segment length now for data sources that contain a valid airspace geometry
  (X-Plane and DFD - FSX/P3D contain invalid segments).
* Fixed several problems with bounding box and overlap calculations around the anti meridian.
* Better handling of X-Plane OpenAirspace comments and fixed problem where airspace names contain a comment character.

1.0.0.beta

* Updated database metadata.
* Fixes for bounding box calculation around the anti meridian.

changes from atools 2.7.0.develop:
* Finished DFD compiler
* Disabling maximum airway segment length for data sources that contain a valid airspace geometry
  (X-Plane and DFD - FSX/P3D contain invalid segments).
* Extended database metadata with optional compiler_version, valid_through and data source columns.
* Better handling of X-Plane OpenAirspace comments and fixed problem where airspace names contain a comment character.
* Fixed problems with bounding box and overlap calculations around the anti meridian.

0.9.9.develop

* Added manual
* Support for DFD and X-Plane databases
* Cleanup in option parsing and better error handling

See atools CHANGELOG.txt for more compiler related changes and fixes

0.9.4.develop

* Removed boundary_line table and pre-calculate boundary geometry now which ist stored as binary data.
* Bumped database version up for changed schema.
* Changed ILS to runway assignment logic to fix ILS data updates.
* Added still unused columns in database for speed limit, airway direction and other extensions for future AIRAC support.
* Added option for two external databases besides the real simulators.

0.9.3.develop

* Several fixes when reading airspace boundaries.
* Added missing indexes to boundary table.
* Fixed reading of airspace boundaries and removed hack.
* Reduced size of airspace enums in database.
* Fixed old problem with empty registry entries when detecting simulator

0.9.2.develop

* Solved problem where airports without delete record lost approaches.
* Cleanup in database around transitions and approaches:
** Navaid ids have to be resolved during runtime now and not during compilation time.
** Fix for multiple navaids with the same name and same region in the database.
** Added more redundant information to runway end table to speed up program during runtime.
* Now nearest VOR and NDBs are assigned to waypoint if duplicates exist.
* Fixed reading of airspace boundary bgl files and reduced string field sizes.

0.9.1.develop

* Initial development version.
* Fixed deploy for Windows
* Fixed error opening database
* Disable foreign keys
